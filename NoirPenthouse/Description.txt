Features a basic defense plot, an IDEK, a medic, and a Okay Diner. Plus a bar marker where the kitchen is. A dual bunk SIMP plot in the back room. Also has a (shrunken down) water container for some water for the bare minimum of self-sufficiency. Oh, and a free cat.

Notes: Honestly, this one was harder to turn into a settlement than it looks, mostly because it decieves you with just how much room it actually has. Which is to say, not a whole lot. 
The first bedroom, the bathrooms, and the crafting area are all untouched.
