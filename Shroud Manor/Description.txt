Shroud Manor Base. Aka: 'Totally not a base we use to keep an eye on those pesky Brotherhooders.'

- I've gone through and redid the doors and restored the . No more Workshop Rearranged, and no more SOE.
- Contains two Martial plots, Two Agri plots (One basic, one Advanced), an IDEK plot (honestly how anyone can try to run without it is beyond me), one Industrial plot, one Water-Industrial plot (Was a municipal but the SS2 default did a weird thing when it was upgraded, blocking the front door with an invis one, so I switched it to that.), A player bedroom, A medic, a player workshop, a JP One more cup of coffee (for the agri plots).
Notes:
- As mentioned, I had to switch the Municipal water plot over to SH Industrial one due to a bug. I think it works better, honestly as it's not necessary to produce that much water.
- I put a kitchen (Relaxation) in the kitchen. 
- The player bedroom could use some decor. It just looks barren as is.
- The Comms plot is kind of shoved into the wall. The idea here is that the screens are the comms, and the 'plot' is just tools for maintainance. 
- The bottom strength plot is not really necessary, but it was either that or another martial plot, which is also not necessary. At least the water/build mat production can increase a little.
-The IDEK plot is also a little shoved into the wall to make it fit, denying access to its locker. Luckily the locker can be accessed in the area upstairs.
- Since Shroud Manor is a lot bigger than all the other CC ones (Except the virtual one of course), I was able to do a lot more with it. Out of all of them, this one is definitely the most 'worth it'. Still don't see it as anything other than a 1 stage though.
