Bottom Floor: Vault-Tech Cola Bar (Yes I use that quite often), IDEK internal, 1x1 Medical. A couple of turrets on stands just to provide some modocum of defense.
  Kitchen has Modular Kitchen replacement in it, and a water-producing sink. Hallway has a Creative Clutter and WSE workbenches. Both of these are optional.
Top Floor: Two 1x1 right side SIMP Bunks in far end. Otherwise, left unchanged.

Notes: ... Look, it's Cafe Ola. AKA the smallest player home ever. There really isn't a whole lot anyone can really do with this place. It's smaller than Home Plate even. There really isn't even room for anything else that I can imagine.
