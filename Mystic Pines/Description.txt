Mystic Pines School of Urbancraft and Settlerly. A 'Settler Training School' settlement designed to churn out skilled settlers for your other settlements. 
Contains a few of each type of SPECIAL training rec plots.
Not really viable as a settlement in of itself. Essentially the idea is you send settlers from other places here, get them assigned to one of the (very numberous) SPECIAL-increasing rec plots, And send ones with maxed out stats that you need back to your settlements, and repeat.
TECHNICALLY holds 40 settlers, but has jobs for less. Even so, still produces an admirable amount of food and building materials.
