Notes:
The 'No Meat' version presumes that you wish to keep the original intent of the Galleria intact: a shopping center run entirely by robots. 
As such, there are no accomidations for human/ghoul settlers such as residential plots or recreational plots.  All 'recruiting' is done via a provided Robot Workbench.
Additionally, there are the addition of 'Turret' towers. 
These towers are located on each corner of the settlement boundaries, and are populated by one turret plot, plus two side laser turrets. 
On top of that, all exits minus the front one are blocked to prevent enemies from moving in from other directions.
There is no roof access, as I have no clue what I'd put up there.
There is a player home and workshop that is hand-made.
