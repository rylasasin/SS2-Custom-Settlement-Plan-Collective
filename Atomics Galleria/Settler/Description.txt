Notes: This one assumes you want to run the settlement like a 'normal' settlement, with few/no robots. 
I on purposefully made everything basic because unlike with robots, you must train settlers and that takes time, and unlike some settlement plans (and unlike the CC settlements) I'm like to NOT require you to import pre-trained settlers to occupy these places. Once trained properly you can adjust certain plots, like the basic ones, later.
